                    As SCRUM Master, I managed the teamâ€™s tasks in Trello and ensured that there were no merge conflicts in Github.
                    Together, we used the React Javascript library and MongoDB to create a webapp for the clinic and
                    developed functionality to create and manage patient appointments with text reminders and 
                    GPS navigation.

                <img src={ghostBoy} alt="Logo" />
                <p>I developed a 3D stealth ghost hunting game within a team environment using the Unity Game Engine.
                    On the project, I controlled Enemy AI using scripts written in C#.

                <img src={turtleTank} alt="Logo" />
                <p>I worked in a team to construct a Self-Caring Turtle Tank capable of feeding the turtles and refilling their tank. We used
                    Arduino Microcontrollers to run the system, with scripts on timers to refill the tank. We also had sensors that could 
                    detect when the water level was low and refill it.
